# We are 4Com Technologies!

Who we are and what we are about!

## Our Values

As a department we've grown and adapted over the last few years, faced challenges like COVID-19 and found new ways of working even when we don't see each other in person every day!

This year we've finally put pen to paper and proudly written down six values that really matter to our teams.
[You can find a PDF of these here](4Com Technology Values.pdf)

### Openness

Transparent teams and Supportive Leadership with 
a no blame Culture. 
Teams are empowered to always present the actual picture, and
 this honesty is met with understanding and support, with a 
collective drive to help and fix rather than find and blame. 

### Collaboration
As part of the Technology Dept we all plan, deliver and Review on
 the same Cadence, maximising opportunities for cross team 
conversations and collaboration. 
Being a primarily remote workforce, we champion face to face 
communication through tools, pairing and swarming on tasks and 
avoiding siloed development as much as possible.

### Adaptability
Here at 4Com we Organise around Value. Our fast paced environment 
does change rapidly, and we need to be flexible and adaptable in
order to deliver the highest value for the company. Priorities change, 
and that’s ok! We don’t dwell on a change of plan, we only see these 
moments as another opportunity to smash it!

### Work Hard Have Fun
Our Dept are driven to deliver value at regular intervals for the 
company and serve their customers with world leading solutions.
As a group we work hard, but it’s important to have fun in our teams. 
The more time at work that doesn’t feel like work the better! 
We embark on team outings and prize giving's regularly both in 
person and remotely. Innovation is encouraged at every turn!

### Continuous Learning, Delivery and Predictability
The Tech Dept are committed to delivering valuable solutions to our 
customers. To do this effectively we work in an Agile way to enable the 
business to pivot and respond quickly to work of the highest value and 
priority. 
Our teams embrace being predictable in delivery, this provides our 
business stakeholders with confidence in longer term planning as well 
as providing the flexibility to deliver short term quick wins! 
All the while, our teams are constantly refining, sharpening their tools 
and processes in order to improve. Change is encouraged from within, 
and we expect our teams to challenge the status quo, for the better!

### Home working Heroes
As a Dept, we are Remote first, and being home based, we trust 
everybody to work responsibly. We have core hours to support, 
however flexibility is available and often self managed within teams.
Responsible remote working, is not only being driven to complete 
tasks remotely, it also means taking care of yourself as a remote 
worker, exercising, socialising and being mindful of your own and 
other’s well-being.
